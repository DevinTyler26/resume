## Technical Experience

My Cool Side Project
: For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
: List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
(with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
your idea...

Programming Languages
: **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
here is a description list where the first few items have their
first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

: **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
perhaps again including a [link][ref], this time placing the url
reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
file).

: **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
it.

: Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

## Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want

- Human Languages:

  - English (native speaker)
  - ???
  - This is what a nested list looks like.

- Random tidbit

- Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
